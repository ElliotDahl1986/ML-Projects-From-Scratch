ANN: A artificial neural network implemented from scratch. I learn the weights and biases through stochastic gradient descent. I use the ANN to identify handwritten numbers (a classic data set). 

RL: Reinforcement learning implented from scratch. I investigate the use of combined modules having their own Q-table. I apply Gibbs policy improvement. I apply this to an environment containg various rewards.
