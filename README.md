In this folder I collect projects where I explore various Machine learning algorithms by building them myself. 

## Contains
### ANN: 
A artificial neural network implemented from scratch. I learn the weights and biases through batch stochastic gradient descent. I test the ANN by identifying handwritten numbers (a classic data set found here http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). 

The backward propagation:

### RL:
Reinforcement learning implented from scratch. I investigate the use of combined modules having their own Q-table. I apply Gibbs policy improvement. I apply this to an environment containg various rewards.  

Gibbs policy improvement:
